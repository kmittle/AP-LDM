# AP-LDM
Official implementation of [***AP-LDM: Attentive and Progressive Latent Diffusion Model for Training-Free High-Resolution Image Generation***](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06055v1).

**AP-LDM** is a framework that enables the rapid synthesis of high-quality, high-resolution images without the need for retraining. It consists of two stages: (1) synthesizing high-quality images at the training resolution using Attentive Guidance, and (2) generating finer high-resolution images through pixel upsampling and "diffusion-denoising."
